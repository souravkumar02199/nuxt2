            <p>At Digital Press, We hold the right to resolve any issue at our own prudence. We will not be legally responsible for any loss of earnings, loss of profits, loss of markets, loss of status, loss of clientele, loss of use or an opportunity,
                even if we had information that such damages or loss could occur or for any indirect, incidental, special, or resulting damages or loss however arising. Including without restriction violation of contract, neglect, willful or act or default.</p>

            <p>Any merchandise that is damaged or printed defectively must be notified to Digital Press within 48 hours of receipt of goods. If no communication is made within 48 hours, it will lead to a loss of rights to a refund or reprint.</p>

            <p>Any products that are undelivered or shipped with damage, intimation has to be made to Digital Press within 48 hours of the items being delivered or the estimated delivery date. If a damaged article has been delivered, it must be noted when
                signing for the delivery.</p>

            <p>Digital Press is not responsible for delays caused by our couriers.</p>

            <p>Products cannot be returned if they did not reach in time for an intended event. Placing order for an event specific time is at the discretion of the customer and Digital Press is not liable if this does not arrive in time. All attempts will
                be made to meet the predetermined deadline.</p>

            <p>In any instance, where Digital Press has wrongly printed or erroneously supplied the product as stated on the purchase order a reprint will be provided without any charges to the customer. If a reprint offer is initiated, the customer must
                accept unless there is a clear cause to not do so. If the customer wishes to alter the artwork prior to the re-print, then this will be treated as a new order and will be consequently charged for.</p>

            <p>Digital Press has the right to offer a reprint and will not be liable for a refund.</p>

            <p>To be eligible to receive replacement products, the customer has to return 95% of the delivered product to Digital Press within 7 days of the original date of delivery. Digital Press shall not be accountable for any price or expenditure borne
                by the customer or any other person or third- party company occurring directly or indirectly out of any print error. If the customer does not return the product, this will be deemed an acceptance of the order.</p>

            <p>It is mandatory to supply images when making a claim about quality of product or any hardware issues. Owing to the made to order nature of the products that Digital Press sells, refunds for products already printed or in the process of printing
                are not feasible.</p>

            <p>Cancellation of orders is permitted if the orders have already not been processed or produced. Consequently, Digital Press is entitled to charge 5% of the order cost and a Â£.. administration and processing fee. If an order has already been
                printed and termination is requested, the client becomes responsible to bear the cost of the order excluding the delivery fee.</p>

            <p>These terms and conditions do not influence your legal rights.</p>
