            <p>While we take up the responsibility to verify the file type and layout of your design, we expect you to check for errors like spelling and grammar mistakes.</p>
            <h2>Checking Proofs</h2>
            <p>Before we give command to print any file, we seek your approval, or expect you to ‘proof’ it – as this task is quite crucial to confirm that what is being printed is accurately what you desire. We have recommended few major aspects to check in the list below, and you take an external help from someone you know to do a crosscheck for you. A new person will be able to scrutinize the content better with a fresh reading and so there is a chance that more errors will be identified by this way.</p>
            <p>Following are the main areas to examine:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Spelling, sentence structure, grammar, and use of punctuation.</li>
                <li>Contact information (example: phone numbers, names, email IDs, dates, times).</li>
                <li>Dimension (between the smallest A7 and the huge A0 – size does count when it comes to print, so make sure that you choose the right size for your product).</li>
                <li>Images and logos- These must be clearly visible and well defined to bring more focus and clarity.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Spelling, Grammar and Punctuation</h3>

            <p>It often happens that a designer retypes details, which have been provided while creating a proof. This is why you must check all components of the design to make certain that these are all accurate. For this purpose, you can make use of available online tools such as spell check to edit your file and create an error-free document ready for print.</p>
            <p>For instance, let us look at some of the most frequently misspelled words and their right spelling:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Definately &#8594; Definitely</li>
                <li>Calender &#8594; calendar</li>
                <li>Jewelry &#8594; Jewellery (the former is correct if you’re using the American spelling)</li>
                <li>Buisness &#8594; business</li>
                <li>Recieve &#8594; Receive</li>
                <li>Seperate &#8594; Separate</li>
            </ul>
            <p>In English language, some words have the same pronunciation but diverse spellings and have completely different meanings. Let us look at some examples:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Personnel and Personal </li>
                <li>We’re and were</li>
                <li>License and Licence</li>
                <li>Stationary and Stationery</li>
                <li>idol and ideal</li>
                <li>There, their and they’re</li>
                <li>To, too and two</li>
                <li>You’re and your</li>
                <li>Practice and Practise</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The word ‘Its’ is often used incorrectly with its counterpart it’s? The little apostrophe in ‘it’s’ shows that it is a contraction as in a letter is missing and the full meaning refers to ‘it is’. You will use ‘it’s’ when you want to convey, “It’s the best print available.” However, ‘Its’ is a type of possessive pronoun, so you will use it in a sentence like “Digitalpress offers printed products from its wide collection”.</p>
            <h3>Focus on Size</h3>
            <p>It is normal to zoom in to verify all the information while you are designing your merchandise. For example, when you examine a business card, you might be zoomed in at 200%, implying the text will seem a lot larger than it would in the final printed product. It would be better to zoom out and scan your design at the final printed size to confirm that all the content is clear, readable, and simple to read and interpret.</p>
            <h3>Using Pictures and Logos</h3>
            <p>When you share your own photos or logo, it would be better to verify that they will be come out clear and well defined in print. For this reason, we suggest that you must always choose the top quality images and do not look into offered printed merchandises, such as business cards, and using those scanned photos for your design. If you want assistance with this, then we offer a useful guide on resolution that you can check out to get more details.</p>
            <h3>What we proofread</h3>
            <p>Though we cannot comprehensively scan for errors of spelling and dates, you can count on us for 10 main checks that our expert Proofing team executes before setting up your artwork to print. This is a manual artwork verification we perform without any charge on every single design you supply us to ensure that your artwork is ready-to-print every time.</p>
