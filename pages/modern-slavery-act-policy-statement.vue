            <p>Digital Press, Modern Slavery Act 2015 Policy Statement</p>
            <p>Digital Press, is a print production and print solutions business. Our head office is based in Leicester UK and as a group we employ over 30 employees.</p>
            <p>Modern slavery encompasses labour mistreatment, domestic bondage, unlawful exploitation, and sexual harassment that may happen not just across international borders but also within a country. Human trafficking, also called trafficking in persons,
                is an offense that includes coercion or forceful bondage of an individual(s) to provide manual labor or services, or to engage in commercial sex acts. The oppression can be subtle or explicit, corporal or mental. The issue of Slavery and
                human trafficking (“Modern Slavery”) is prevalent on a global level.</p>

            <p>At Digital Press, bondage and human trafficking in any form is completely unacceptable. We expect from our employees to emphasize concerns that they may have, using the suitable reporting channels, and administration is expected to take action
                in view of that.</p>

            <p>As a part of the printing industry, Digital Press understands that it is accountable to adopt a vigorous plan to combat modern slavery and human trafficking. We are dedicated in providing equal opportunities to members from all sections of
                society while establishing a non- prejudiced, safe, as well as respectful work atmosphere for our employees.</p>

            <p>Modern slavery and human trafficking are critical and often concealed crimes that can be destructive for the victims. Digital Press is devoted to frequently assessing risks associated with modern slavery and human trafficking that could be
                instigated by, contributed to, or directly related to our business operations or within our supply chains. We consider these risks relatively low in our direct business operations, as our immediate personnel mainly includes professionally
                competent or trained employees.</p>
